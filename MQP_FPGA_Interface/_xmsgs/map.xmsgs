<msg type="error" file="Pack" num="2908" delta="old" >The I/O component &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">fpga_clk_P</arg>&quot; has an illegal IOSTANDARD value.  The <arg fmt="%s" index="2">IOB</arg> component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can not use differential IOSTANDARD value <arg fmt="%s" index="3">LVDS_33</arg>.  Two ways to rectify this issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2) Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.
