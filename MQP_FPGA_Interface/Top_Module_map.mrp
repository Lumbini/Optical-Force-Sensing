Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :   1

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "fpga_clk_P" has an illegal IOSTANDARD
   value.  The IOB component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can
   not use differential IOSTANDARD value LVDS_33.  Two ways to rectify this
   issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2)
   Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:43 - No license file was found in the standard Xilinx license
directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - Since no license file was found,
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal fpga_clk_N connected to top level port fpga_clk_N
   has been removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:50 - The XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is set to
'2100@xilinx.wpi.edu'.
INFO:Security:53 - The LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is not set.
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc6slx9' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network ADC1_SDATA0_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 1 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   ADC1_SDATA1_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
