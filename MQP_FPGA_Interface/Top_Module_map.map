Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal fpga_clk_N connected to top level port fpga_clk_N
   has been removed.
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "fpga_clk_P" has an illegal IOSTANDARD
   value.  The IOB component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can
   not use differential IOSTANDARD value LVDS_33.  Two ways to rectify this
   issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2)
   Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.

Mapping completed.
See MAP report file "Top_Module_map.mrp" for details.
