Contributers: James Maliff, Brian Hecker, Corin Rypkema, Lumbini Parnas

A force sensing technique to measure the forces in a needle during a biopsy. Our goal is to allow surgeons to study the tissue boundary of the organ in real-time. The technique further allows the biopsy to be automated and performed by a robot by implementing a control system for the force used to insert the needle. This project involves designing the fixture to attach the Fabry Perot Interferometer on to and translate the forces from the needle to optical signals which will be measured by a photodiode and analyzed by a customs made software.
